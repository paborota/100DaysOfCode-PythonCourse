# 100DaysOfCode-PythonCourse

This is the accumulation of code that i've written while taking the 100 Days of Code udemy course.

Putting it all in one single repo, due to there being quite a few, and they all are related by the course. Some of the challenges are small to where they don't need their own repo. Will most likely give bigger ones their own later on.


Side note: Will only be uploading the "challenges" of the course as time goes on, there have already been a lot of days skipped because it was language introductory material.
